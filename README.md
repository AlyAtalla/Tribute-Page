## Introduction

Alan Turing is widely considered the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. During World War II, he played a crucial role in breaking the German Enigma code, which significantly contributed to the Allied victory. Despite his immense contributions, Turing faced persecution due to his homosexuality, which was then criminalized in the UK. He tragically died in 1954. Today, Turing is celebrated for his groundbreaking work and his enduring impact on modern technology.
